Owner access on a repository owned by a user account

The repository owner has full control of the repository. In addition to all the permissions allowed by repository collaborators, the repository owner can:

Add collaborators
Change the visibility of the repository (from public to private, or from private to public)
Delete the repository
There is only one owner of a repository owned by a user account; this permission cannot be shared with another user account. To transfer ownership of a repository to another user, see "How to transfer a repository."

Collaborator access on a repository owned by a user account

Collaborators on a private repository can:

Push to (write), pull from (read), and fork (copy) the repository
Apply labels and milestones
Open, close, re-open, and assign issues
Edit and delete comments on commits, pull requests, and issues
Merge and close pull requests
Send pull requests from forks of the repository
Create and edit Wikis
Create and edit Releases
Remove themselves as collaborators on the repository
